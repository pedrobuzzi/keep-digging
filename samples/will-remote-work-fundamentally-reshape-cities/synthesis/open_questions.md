## SECTION 3 — Open Questions

**1. What is remote work's causal elasticity on location choice, isolated from confounders?**
Current migration data conflates remote work with tax migration, housing cost shocks, pandemic psychology, and pre-existing Sun Belt trends. No published multi-variate regression isolates remote work's partial effect. Quasi-experimental designs exploiting employer return-to-office mandates or state-level policy variation could establish causal estimates. Without this, confidence in remote work as the *primary* driver of observed shifts remains low (25–35%).

**2. At what vacancy threshold do fiscal cascades actually activate?**
The "doom loop" hypothesis identifies 30–35% commercial vacancy as a potential tipping point, but this threshold has no empirical validation. Historical case studies of cities that experienced commercial property collapses (Detroit, Cleveland) could calibrate expectations, though comparability is limited. This matters because it determines whether current vacancy levels represent manageable decline or proximity to nonlinear collapse.

**3. How will AI expand the scope of remoteable work, and on what timeline?**
AI is the single variable most likely to shift the question from "incremental redistribution" to "structural transformation." Current estimates of 40–50% remoteable work by 2030–2035 are speculative. Tracking AI adoption in judgment-intensive professions (law, finance, consulting, healthcare administration) would provide early indicators.

**4. What are developing-world urbanization dynamics, and do they decouple from this analysis?**
Nearly all analysis centers on developed-world knowledge-economy cities. Developing-world urbanization is driven by manufacturing, poverty escape, and infrastructure access — forces orthogonal to remote work. Whether the global urbanization trend masks developed-world hollowing is a critical question for understanding aggregate statistics.

**5. Will Gen Z professional identity formation remain detached from urban location?**
Workers entering the labor market since 2020 built professional identities in remote-first environments. If their urban living preferences are conditional on affordability rather than career proximity, cities lose their most powerful demographic renewal mechanism. Longitudinal tracking of career outcomes and location choices for this cohort would clarify whether this represents a generational shift or a life-stage effect that reverts as workers age.

**6. Can office-to-residential conversion happen at sufficient scale and speed?**
NYC has ~20,000 units in its conversion pipeline, but physical and fiscal constraints limit realistic conversion to 10–15% of obsolete stock, and the process takes 8–15 years. Whether conversion can absorb vacancy before fiscal damage accumulates — and whether converted buildings generate comparable tax revenue — determines whether adaptation outpaces decline.

**7. Does the loss of shared urban space measurably erode civic and democratic participation?**
The hypothesis that remote-enabled self-sorting undermines democratic pluralism is philosophically compelling but empirically untested. Comparative studies of civic engagement in remote-heavy versus office-heavy metro areas, controlling for demographics, could provide initial evidence. This matters because it represents a potential cost of urban reshaping invisible to economic metrics.

**8. What replacement "keystone species" can sustain urban ecosystems after the office's decline?**
Cities that successfully transitioned from industrial to knowledge economies identified new anchoring institutions. The equivalent challenge now is identifying what replaces the office as the organizing node for surrounding economic ecosystems (restaurants, retail, transit, childcare). Universities, hospitals, and creative/entertainment districts are candidates, but no systematic assessment of their ecosystem-generating capacity exists.
