## SECTION 2 — Key Findings

- **[HIGH]** Remote work has permanently reduced office demand by 20–40%, with downtown vacancy rates stabilizing at 20–25% nationally — a structural shift, not a cyclical one.

- **[HIGH]** The dominant spatial effect is intra-metropolitan redistribution (core to suburbs/exurbs), not inter-city migration or rural dispersal. 85–90% of remote workers remained in their home metro area.

- **[HIGH]** The commercial real estate market is bifurcating: Class A buildings maintain near-normal occupancy while Class B/C stock faces potential obsolescence, creating uneven rather than universal urban stress.

- **[HIGH]** Cities persist due to irreducible functions (shared infrastructure, social markets, service economies, sunk capital) that remote work does not affect. Urbanization as a global trend will continue.

- **[MEDIUM]** High-earner mobility creates disproportionate fiscal impact: small population losses can trigger large revenue losses, as demonstrated by San Francisco's post-2020 experience.

- **[MEDIUM]** The temporal desynchronization of urban life (collapse of shared commute/lunch/transit rhythms) may be more consequential than spatial redistribution, but this effect is poorly measured.

- **[MEDIUM]** Remote work functions as a class-sorting mechanism, expanding options for high-earners while trapping essential workers in declining urban cores with reduced services.

- **[MEDIUM]** Historical precedent suggests 20 years is insufficient for full transformation — we are likely in the early phase of a 40–50 year transition comparable to automobile-driven suburbanization.

- **[MEDIUM]** Policy will mediate outcomes more than technology alone. Japan's remote work adoption without deurbanization, and the U.S. automobile experience (shaped by FHA lending, highway investment, and zoning), demonstrate that technology enables while policy determines.

- **[LOW]** AI expansion of remoteable work from 30–35% to 40–50% could trigger a phase transition from incremental redistribution to structural transformation — the single most important variable, but highly uncertain.

- **[LOW]** The "urban doom loop" (vacancy → fiscal crisis → service cuts → further exodus) has theoretical support but no city has yet crossed the hypothesized tipping point of 30–35% sustained vacancy.

- **[LOW]** New geographic organizing principles (time zones, regulatory environments, visa programs) may create genuinely novel urban typologies — "container-equivalent cities" optimized for distributed work — but evidence remains anecdotal.
