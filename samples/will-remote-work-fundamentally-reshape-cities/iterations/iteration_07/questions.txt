1. **What are employers actually doing (not saying) about remote work, and what does their capital allocation reveal?** Corporate lease decisions, office buildout investments, and hiring patterns are harder to fake than press releases about "return to office culture." Where is the money going?
2. **Who actually moves when they go remote, and what do they do with their savings?** The abstract "remote worker leaves city" narrative ignores that most people don't move at all. Of those who do, how far do they go, and does the economic activity they generate simply shift within the same metro?
3. **What concrete infrastructure and service changes are cities already making in response—and are any working?** Forget predictions. What have San Francisco, New York, and other affected cities actually done (office-to-residential conversions, zoning changes, tax incentives), and what measurable results have those interventions produced?
4. **What does the commercial real estate workout actually look like on the ground—distressed sales, conversions, or zombie buildings?** The "doom loop" theory assumes cascading defaults. What's the actual resolution pathway for underwater office buildings in practice?
5. **For the average person deciding where to live right now, what actually changed?** Strip away the macro trends. What's the practical calculus for a 30-year-old knowledge worker choosing between San Francisco and Austin today versus 2019?
