If cities are synchronization machines (coordinating millions around shared schedules), what happens when remote work desynchronizes urban life—and is the temporal disruption more consequential than the spatial one?
Does remote work eliminate geography or create *new* geographies (time zones, regulatory clusters, language networks)—and what does this imply for which cities win?
The office functioned as an urban "keystone species" organizing surrounding ecosystems; what trophic cascades occur when it's removed, and what species replaces it?
Are cities undergoing gradual linear change or a phase transition (supercooling toward crystallization)—and does the distinction change everything about prediction?
Are we measuring the wrong layer of cities (physical/economic) while the deepest layer (social/identity function) undergoes the most fundamental reshaping?
