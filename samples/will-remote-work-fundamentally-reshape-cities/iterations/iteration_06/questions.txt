1. **What is the causal contribution of remote work adoption versus confounding factors (pandemic psychology, tax flight, cost-of-living migration) in explaining post-2020 migration patterns?** – The data shows San Francisco population decline and secondary city growth, but multi-variate regression controlling for tax rate changes, housing cost shocks, and pandemic-driven behavior hasn't been presented. This is essential for distinguishing remote work's effect from noise.
2. **What empirical threshold of commercial real estate vacancy (20%? 30%? 40%?) triggers observable fiscal cascades (property tax revenue collapse, service degradation, mortgage defaults), and do we have historical precedents to validate the "doom loop" hypothesis?** – Prior analysis identified tipping points conceptually, but actual data from recession cycles or declining metros is absent. Without historical validation, cascade claims remain speculative.
3. **For which specific city characteristics—industry composition, commercial RE concentration, policy environment, building stock—is remote work's measured impact on urban viability substantial versus marginal?** – Research acknowledges heterogeneity but provides no quantitative vulnerability scoring. This would enable falsifiable predictions (e.g., "tech-heavy cities with 25%+ commercial RE will show >12% population decline by 2030").
4. **What do quasi-experimental designs reveal about remote work's elasticity on location choice—employer RTO mandates, regional adoption variation, or policy interventions that provide exogenous variation in remote work availability?** – Causal estimates of how location decisions respond to remote work options are absent from the literature cited. This is foundational for modeling long-term impacts.
5. **How does revealed preference (where people actually moved when given full choice) differ from stated preference in surveys, and what do Gen Z's actual location choices (versus survey answers) show about durability of remote work's effects?** – Preference data matters, but behavioral data is more informative. Has anyone tracked cohorts over 4-5 years to measure who stayed in remote-accessible cheaper cities versus those who returned?
