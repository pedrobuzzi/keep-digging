1. **What are the irreducible physical reasons humans cluster in cities, and which of these does remote work actually eliminate?** Cities exist for reasons beyond office work — supply chain logistics, physical infrastructure sharing, social bonding, governance, cultural production, healthcare, education. Which of these "agglomeration forces" does remote work neutralize, and which remain untouched?
2. **What is the actual upper bound of "remote-workable" jobs as a share of total urban economic activity?** We often hear about knowledge workers going remote, but what percentage of a city's economy do they represent versus service, healthcare, manufacturing, construction, logistics, and government workers who must be physically present?
3. **Does remote work eliminate the need for proximity, or merely change its frequency and nature?** There's a difference between "I never need to be in the city" and "I need to be there 2 days a week instead of 5." The latter still anchors people within commuting range and may reshape cities differently than full dispersal would.
4. **What are the feedback loops and second-order effects — does partial depopulation of city cores make cities MORE or LESS attractive to the remaining population?** If some workers leave, does that reduce congestion and cost, making cities more livable for those who stay? Or does it erode the tax base and service quality, triggering a doom loop?
5. **Historically, how have previous "death of distance" technologies (telegraph, telephone, automobile, internet 1.0) actually affected urban concentration?** Every major communication technology was predicted to disperse cities. What actually happened, and why?
