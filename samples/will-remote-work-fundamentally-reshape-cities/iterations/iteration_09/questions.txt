1. **Who bears the costs of urban restructuring, and does remote work amplify pre-existing inequalities?** Iterations 1-8 treat cities as aggregate systems, but restructuring has winners (high-skilled remote workers with location arbitrage) and losers (immobile workers, service sector, municipal employees). Does remote work enable affluent professionals to escape cities while locking lower-income residents into declining urban cores?
2. **What is the moral status of "choice" in remote work migration—is it genuine autonomy or constrained within structural inequalities?** If remote work appears to expand autonomy (choice of where to live) but only for certain classes, does it deepen injustice by making inequality appear voluntary rather than systemic?
3. **What responsibilities do employers, tech companies, and policymakers bear for managing the human and social costs of urban decline?** Current frameworks treat urban transformation as a market outcome. From an ethical standpoint, who is accountable for the fiscal cascade effects (service degradation, school closures) that harm vulnerable populations left behind?
4. **Does the desynchronization of urban life (Iteration 8's keystone insight) harm our capacity for collective democratic deliberation and shared moral community?** If cities lose their function as "synchronization machines," do we lose mechanisms for diverse groups to coexist, encounter difference, and negotiate shared futures?
5. **Are we treating the question of "urban reshaping" backwards—prioritizing capital efficiency over human flourishing?** What would the question look like if we centered the needs of vulnerable populations (elderly, disabled, low-income, isolated), rather than treating them as externalities to remote work's efficiency gains?
