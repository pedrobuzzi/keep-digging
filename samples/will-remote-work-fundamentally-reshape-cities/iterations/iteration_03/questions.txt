1. **Did previous transportation revolutions (railroad, streetcar, automobile) fundamentally reshape cities or merely *which cities grew and where*?** If cities persisted through each technology shift despite losing their presumed economic advantage, what was actually reshaping—the city form or the distribution of growth across the urban system?
2. **What is the historical pattern of *reversal* in urban migration?** Downtowns declined 1960s-1990s yet revived 2000s despite continued car ownership. What caused that reversal, and does remote work break or accelerate this cycle?
3. **How do we distinguish between "fundamental reshaping" and "structural oscillation"?** Historical cities have experienced 20-30 year cycles of decline and renewal (postwar exodus, 1970s urban crisis, 1990s gentrification revival). Is remote work a permanent inflection point or another cycle?
4. **What role did *deliberate policy* and institutional change play in past urban transformations, separate from technology adoption?** Suburbanization wasn't inevitable—tax policy (mortgage interest deduction), FHA lending discrimination, highway subsidies, zoning laws, and white flight shaped it. What policies might amplify or dampen remote work's urban effects?
5. **How do we account for the *persistence of cities despite economic obsolescence*?** Detroit, Pittsburgh, and Buffalo lost their economic raison d'être (auto manufacturing, steel) yet remained cities. What urban gravity persists even when the original economic function disappears?
