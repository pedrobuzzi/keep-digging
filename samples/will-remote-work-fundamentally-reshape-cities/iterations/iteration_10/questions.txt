1. **What is the minimum coherent prediction framework that all nine prior perspectives would accept?** Each iteration added complexity—can we identify a "load-bearing wall" set of claims that survive every critique (empiricist, pragmatist, ethical, creative)?
2. **Does the convergence across perspectives on "heterogeneous, uneven reshaping" constitute a substantive answer or an evasion?** Every iteration concluded "it depends on the city." Is this genuine insight or analytical failure to commit?
3. **What would falsify the synthesis itself?** If we identify a single mechanism (e.g., AI expanding remote work to 50%+ of jobs by 2035) that could override the gradualist consensus, does our probabilistic framework account for it, or does it structurally underweight tail risks?
4. **Can we reconcile the temporal paradox: historical analogy suggests 40-50 year transitions, but digital infrastructure enables faster adoption curves than physical infrastructure ever did?** The shipping container took 20 years; the smartphone took 10; remote work tools achieved mass adoption in months. Does this invalidate the slow-transition assumption?
5. **What is the integrated causal model—not a list of factors, but a structured diagram of which causes which, with what strength and under what conditions?**
