1. **What are the critical feedback loops between remote work adoption and urban viability, and which are reinforcing versus balancing?** (e.g., remote work → lower tax revenue → worse services → more departure = reinforcing; remote work → lower rents → artists/startups move in → cultural revival = balancing)
2. **Where are the system's tipping points—at what threshold of remote work adoption do nonlinear urban effects emerge?** (e.g., what office vacancy rate triggers commercial real estate debt crises that cascade into municipal bond defaults and service cuts?)
3. **How does the remote work system interact with adjacent systems—housing markets, immigration, climate migration, AI automation—and which coupling is tightest?** (Remote work doesn't operate in isolation; its urban impact may be dominated by interactions with these other forces.)
4. **What are the emergent properties of hybrid work that neither "fully remote" nor "fully in-office" models predict?** (Hybrid creates novel spatial patterns—the 3-day-a-week commuter has different infrastructure demands than either extreme.)
5. **Who are the agents in this system, what are their incentive structures, and where do principal-agent conflicts create unexpected outcomes?** (Employers want control, workers want flexibility, cities want tax revenue, commercial landlords want occupancy, developers want to build—these competing incentives produce emergent equilibria.)
