## Original Question
Is serverless actually cheaper, or are companies just hiding complexity and cost?

## Your Current Perspective: Skeptical Critic
Challenge every claim and conclusion reached so far. Look for logical fallacies, weak evidence, confirmation bias, and unsupported leaps. Ask: what evidence would DISPROVE this? What are we getting wrong? What inconvenient facts are being ignored?

## Research So Far
### Iteration 1 (First Principles Thinker)
## Serverless Cost Analysis: Compressed Summary

**Key Insight:** Serverless is genuinely cheaper only for low, sporadic workloads—not a universal cost win.

**Sub-Questions Generated:**
1. How do actual cost components (compute, memory, cold starts, orchestration) map across serverless vs. traditional infrastructure?
2. What is true TCO including vendor lock-in, observability tooling, and engineering time?
3. At what utilization threshold does serverless become more expensive? (Empirically: ~15-20% for Lambda vs. EC2)
4. Are companies trading one cost type (infrastructure ops) for another (architectural complexity, debugging)?
5. Do cloud providers and consultants have incentives to oversell serverless regardless of economics?

**First-Principles Foundation:**
- All computation requires physical resources; serverless merely abstracts management
- Pay-per-use is only cheaper than reserved capacity when utilization is low—mathematical certainty
- Lambda costs ~$0.0000166667/GB-second vs. EC2 at ~$0.00001156/GB-second when fully utilized
- Hidden operational costs often ignored: cold-start latency, observability complexity, architectural overhead (API Gateway, SQS, SNS charges), vendor lock-in switching costs, and engineering time

**Core Problem:** Companies measure serverless savings narrowly (just Lambda invocation costs) while ignoring the constellation of additional AWS services, tooling, and complexity their serverless architecture requires. They're not intentionally hiding costs—they're systematically *underaccounting* for them.

**Why Confusion Persists:**
- Cloud providers benefit from serverless (higher revenue per compute cycle)
- "Cheaper" conflates unrelated dimensions: infrastructure management time, raw compute cost, architectural complexity, time-to-market, operational maturity
- Serverless can be simultaneously cheaper in time-to-market and more expensive in total cost of ownership

**Progress: 4/10**
Establishes foundational economics and key variables but lacks empirical case studies, long-term cost evolution, organizational impacts, and analysis of emerging alternatives (containers-as-a-service, edge compute).

## Your Task
Adopt the "Skeptical Critic" perspective fully. Your job is to advance our understanding of the original question.

Instructions:
1. Review what has been covered so far (if anything). Do NOT repeat prior findings.
2. Identify gaps, weaknesses, or underexplored angles in the existing research.
3. Generate 3-5 NEW sub-questions that dig deeper, challenge assumptions, or explore neglected dimensions.
4. Provide substantive analysis that adds genuine new insight from your perspective.
5. Assess overall progress toward answering the original question.

You MUST structure your response with these exact section headers:

## New Sub-Questions
- List 3-5 new sub-questions that would deepen understanding

## Analysis
Your substantive contribution from the Skeptical Critic perspective. Be thorough and specific. Include evidence, reasoning, and concrete examples where possible.

## Progress Assessment
Rate progress toward fully answering the original question on a scale of 1-10, where:
- 1-3: Still exploring the surface
- 4-6: Good foundation, significant gaps remain
- 7-8: Strong understanding, some nuances to explore
- 9-10: Comprehensive understanding achieved
Score: X/10
Brief justification for the score.
