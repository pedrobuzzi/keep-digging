# Serverless Cost Analysis: Iteration 2 Summary

## Critical Sub-Questions
- **Survivorship bias**: Public serverless case studies skew positive (success stories published, failures hidden). How does the actual failure rate compare to the curated evidence base?
- **Comparison baseline**: Serverless vs. raw EC2 is a strawman. Modern alternatives (Fargate, Cloud Run, Kubernetes with KEDA, Spot instances, Savings Plans) often outcompete serverless economically—yet these comparisons are rarely made.
- **Structural incentives**: AWS earns higher margins on Lambda than EC2; consultants profit from architectural complexity; engineers build career capital through serverless adoption. Does this explain cost claims better than incompetence?
- **Complexity transfer costs**: Moving from infrastructure ops to distributed systems debugging isn't neutral. Serverless failure modes (cold start races, silent SQS drops, complex Step Functions workflows) require expensive observability tools ($3K–$30K/month)—rarely included in cost analyses.

## Key Findings
The prior analysis was too charitable. Rather than innocent "underaccounting," structural incentives predict deliberate cost obscuring. Specific figures cited (Lambda pricing, breakeven thresholds) lacked sources and ignored workload variability. 

AWS's pricing architecture deliberately obscures aggregate costs: Lambda's sub-penny granularity, API Gateway's per-million-request billing, and CloudWatch's per-GB ingestion charges hide scaled expenses better than monthly EC2 invoices. The unit economics visibility problem isn't accidental—it reduces cost scrutiny.

Prime Video's 2023 serverless-to-monolith migration is notable precisely because it's rare public admission of failure. The absence of serverless postmortems suggests systematic reporting bias, not evidence of success.

## Progress: 5/10
Iteration 1 established foundational cost math and hidden category identification. Iteration 2 challenges assumptions and identifies incentive structures but remains primarily theoretical. Lacking: empirical case studies with actual costs, temporal analysis of scaling dynamics, and organizational decision-making mechanics behind false claims.
