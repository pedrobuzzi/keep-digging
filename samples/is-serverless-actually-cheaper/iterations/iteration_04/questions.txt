1. **What are the feedback loops that lock organizations into serverless architectures even when cost signals indicate they should migrate away?** (Sunk cost in architecture, team skill specialization, vendor-specific tooling dependencies, and career incentives create reinforcing loops that resist correction.)
2. **How does the boundary between "your system" and "the platform" shift cost visibility and accountability?** (Serverless moves critical components outside the system boundary you monitor — queue latency, cold start behavior, throttling limits — making cost attribution structurally harder, not just culturally neglected.)
3. **What are the second and third-order effects of serverless on organizational structure, hiring, and knowledge distribution?** (Teams optimized for serverless lose infrastructure intuition; when they hit scale thresholds requiring migration, they lack the skills to execute it — creating a competency trap.)
4. **Where are the leverage points where a small intervention could dramatically change the cost outcome of a serverless deployment?** (Workload characterization before architecture selection, continuous cost monitoring with automated alerts, and hybrid architecture patterns at function-group boundaries.)
5. **How do emergent properties of serverless systems — properties that don't exist in any single function but arise from their interaction — create unpredictable cost behaviors?** (Fan-out amplification, retry storms, cascading timeouts across service meshes produce non-linear cost spikes invisible at the component level.)
