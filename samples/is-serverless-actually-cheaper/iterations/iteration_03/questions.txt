1. **Abstraction layer patterns**: Serverless is the latest in a 60-year cycle of IT "cost reduction through abstraction" (mainframes → minicomputers → PCs → x86 servers → virtualization → cloud → containers → serverless). Did prior abstraction shifts deliver on cost promises, and on what timeline was reality reconciled with marketing?
2. **ASP parallel collapse**: The Application Service Provider (ASP) bubble (1995-2005) made nearly identical cost-centralization promises and failed catastrophically. What structural conditions allowed serverless to survive where ASPs died? Do cost dynamics explain the difference, or only narrative discipline?
3. **Peak narrative and dissent timing**: When did the "serverless is cheaper" narrative peak, and when did observable organizational dissent begin (Prime Video 2023, others)? Does the timeline correlate with industry maturity cycles, and can cost-discovery lag be quantified?
4. **AWS pricing evolution as confound**: Lambda's unit pricing has declined ~50% since 2014, while execution times have improved and feature coverage expanded. Did serverless become "cheaper," or did AWS prices fall while architectural requirements (orchestration overhead, observability) increased? How do these countervailing forces net out?
5. **Exit velocity and organizational characteristics**: Who exits serverless (Prime Video, others) and who deepens investment (Stripe, Slack)? Do organizational characteristics (scale, verticality, geographic footprint, capital structure) predict exit more reliably than cost as the stated reason?
